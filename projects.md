## LiveHD

Projects for [LiveHD](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd). Lead Mentors: Jose Renau <mailto:renau@ucsc.edu> and Sheng-Hong Wang <mailto:swang203@ucsc.edu>

### Tree sitter Pyrope

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Tree-sitter Pyrope  |
| Description | Work on a tree-sitter grammar for Pyrope |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17, Parsing |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#tree-sitter-pyrope)

Using [https://github.com/tekinengin/tree-sitter-pyrope](https://github.com/tekinengin/tree-sitter-pyrope) as a starting point, complete the Pyrope grammar
to correctly parse the [Pyrope grammar](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/pyrope.html), interface with LiveHD
and third party tools.

Main features:

* Pyrope tree-sitter grammar
* tree-sitter to LNAST generation (Comparable to https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/tree/master/inou/pyrope)
* Atom and neovim integration
* Atom go definition, highlight, and attribute
* Atom capacity to query LNAST/Lgraph generated grammar for bit-width. The incremental grammar passed to LNAST, passed to Lgraph,
  and incremental bit-width inference.
* neovim highlight, indent, fold support
* Integrate with atom-hide as extra language

In addition to the packages, there should be an iterator that use the incremental builder to support incremental changes.


### Mockturtle

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Mockturtle |
| Description | Perform synthesis for graph in LiveHD using Mockturtle |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17, synthesis |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#mockturtle)

There are some issues with Mockturtle integration (new cells) and it is not using the latest Mockturtle library versions.
The goal is to use Mockturtle (https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle) with LiveHD. The main characteristics:

* Use mockturtle to tmap to LUTs
* Use mockturtle to synthesize (optimize) logic
* Enable cut-rewrite as an option
* Enable hierarchy cross optimization (hier:true option)
* Use the graph labeling to find cluster to optimize
* Re-timing
* Map to LUTs only gates and non-wide arithmetic. E.g: 32bit add is not mapped to LUTS, but a 2-bit add is mapped.
* List of resources to not map:
    * Large ALUs. Large ALUs should have an OpenWare block (hardcoded in FPGAs and advanced adder options in ASIC)
    * Multipliers and dividers
    * Barrell shifters with not trivial shifts (1-2 bits) selectable at run-time
    * memories, luts

### Query Shell

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Query Shell |
| Description | Create a console app that interacts with LiveHD to query parameters about designs |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#query-shell-not-lgshell-to-query-graphs)

* Based on replxx (like lgshell)
* Query bits, ports...  like
    * https://github.com/rubund/netlist-analyzer
    * https://www.jameswhanlon.com/querying-logical-paths-in-a-verilog-design.html
* It would be cool if subsections (selected) parts can be visualized with something like https://github.com/nturley/netlistsvg
* The shell may be expanded to support simulation in the future
* Wavedrom/Duh dumps

Wavedrom and duh allows to dump bitfield information for structures. It would be interesting to explore to dump tables and bit
fields for Lgraph IOs, and structs/fields inside the module. It may be a way to integrate with the documentation generation.

Example of queries: show path, show driver/sink of, do topo traversal,....

As an interesting extension would be to have some simple embedded language (TCL or ChaiScript or ???) to control queries more
easily and allow to build functions/libraries.

### Lgraph and LNAST check pass

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | Lgraph and LNAST check pass |
| Description | Create a pass that check the integrity/correctness of Lgraph and LNAST |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#lgraph-and-lnast-check-pass)

Create a pass that checks that the Lgraph (and/or LNAST) is semantically
correct. The LNAST already has quite a few tests (pass.semantic), but it can be
further expanded. Some checks:

* No combinational loops
* No mismatch in bit widths
* No disconnected nodes
* Check for inefficient splits (do not split buses that can be combined)
* Transformations stages should not drop names if same net is preserved
* No writes in LNAST that are never read
* All the edges are possible. E.g: no pin 'C' in Sum_op


### unbitwidth

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | unbitwidth |
| Description | Not all the variables need bitwidth information. Find the small subset |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#unbitwidth-local-and-global-bitwidth)

This pass is needed to create less verbose CHISEL and Pyrope code generation.

The LGraph can have bitwidth information for each dpin. This is needed for
Verilog code generation, but not needed for Pyrope or CHISEL.  CHISEL can
perform local bitwidth inference and Pyrope can perform global bitwidth
inference.

A new pass should remove redundant bitwidth information. The information is
redundant because the pass/bitwidth can regenerate it if there is enough
details. The goal is to create a pass/unbitwidth that removes either local or
global bitwidth. The information left should be enough for the bitwidth pass to
regenerate it.

* Local bitwidth: It is possible to leave the bitwidth information in many
places and it will have the same results, but for CHISEL the inputs should be
sized. The storage (memories/flops) should have bitwidth when can not be
inferred from the inputs.

* Global bitwidth: Pyrope bitwidth inference goes across the call hierarchy.
This means that a module could have no bitwidth information at all. We start
from the leave nodes. If all the bits can be inferred given the inputs, the
module should have no bitwidth. In that case the bitwidth can be inferred from
outside.

### LNAST Opt

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Title | LNAST Opt |
| Description | Perform copy propagation, constant folding, and dce at LNAST level |
| Mentor(s) | Jose Renau|
| Skills | C++17 |
| Difficulty | Medium |
| [Link](https://github.com/masc-ucsc/livehd/blob/master/docs/cross.md#lnast-opt)

In LiveHD, LGraph has the cprop pass that performs constant folding, copy
propagation, strength reduction... and many other optimizations.


It may be useful to have a copy propagation, constant folding, and dead code
elimination in LNAST. There are several reasons:

* Doing code simplification early (LNAST is the earliest) reduces workload/steps in successive passes.
* The simulation saves checkpoints, a LNAST Opt without dead code elimination would be useful to create the intermediate values for debugging.

## Eusocial Storage Devices

As storage devices get faster, data management tasks rob the host of CPU cycles and main memory bandwidth. The [Eusocial project](https://cross.ucsc.edu/projects/eusocialpage.html) aims to create a new interface to storage devices that can leverage existing and new CPU and main memory resources to take over data management tasks like availability, recovery, and migrations. The project refers to these storage devices as “eusocial” because we are inspired by eusocial insects like ants, termites, and bees, which as individuals are primitive but collectively accomplish amazing things.

### Evaluating user space networking stacks on SmartNICs

 - **Skills:** C, Bash, performance evaluation tools (Linux perf, SystemTap, etc.)
 - **Difficulty:** Easy
 - **Mentor:** Jianshen Liu <mailto:jliu120@ucsc.edu>

The BlueField DPU as an example of SmartNICs is available nowadays. However, the performance of the kernel networking stack on this device is known to involve expensive overhead. The alternatives are to use some user-space solutions such as DPDK (for TCP and RDMA) and libvma (for RDMA). Therefore, it would be interesting to evaluate the performance differences between the kernel and these user-space alternatives, especially focusing on characterizing the benefits for SmartNICs.

### Dynamic function injection for RocksDB

 - **Skills:** C/C++, Java
 - **Difficulty:** Challenging
 - **Mentor:** Jianshen Liu <mailto:jliu120@ucsc.edu>

Recent research reveals that the compaction process in RocksDB can be altered to optimize future data access by changing the data layout in compaction levels. The benefit of this approach can be extended to different data layout optimization based on application access patterns and requirements. In this project, we want to create an interface that would allow users to dynamically inject layout optimization functions to RockDB, using containerization technologies such as Webassembly.

### Demonstrating a composable storage system accelerated by memory semantic technologies

 - **Skills:** C/C++, Bash, Python, System architecture, Network fabrics
 - **Difficulty:** Challenging
 - **Mentor:** Jianshen Liu <mailto:jliu120@ucsc.edu>

Since the last decade, the slowing down in the performance improvement of general-purpose processors is driving the system architecture to be increasingly heterogeneous. We have seen the kinds of domain-specific accelerator hardware (e.g., FPAG, SmartNIC, TPU, GPU) are growing to take over many different jobs from the general-purpose processors. On the other hand, the network and storage device performance have been tremendously improved with a trajectory much outweighed than that of processors. With this trend, a natural thought to continuously scale the storage system performance economically is to efficiently utilize and share different sources from different nodes over the network. There already exist different resource sharing protocols like CCIX, CXL, and GEN-Z. Among these GEN-Z is the most interesting because, unlike RDMA, it enables remote memory accessing without exposing details to applications (i.e., not application changes). Therefore, it would be interesting to see how/whether these technologies can help improve the performance of storage systems, and to what extent. This project would require building a demo system that uses some of these technologies (especially GEN-Z) and run selected applications/workloads to better understand the benefits.

## Open Source Autonomous Vehicle Controller


The OSAVC is a vehicle-agnostic open source hardware and software project.  This project is designed to provide a real-time hardware controller adaptable to any vehicle type, suitable for aerial, terrestrial, marine, or extraterrestrial vehicles. It allows control researchers to develop state estimation algorithms, sensor calibration algorithms, and vehicle control models in a modular fashion such that once the hardware set has been developed switching algorithms requires only modifying one C function and recompiling.

Lead mentor: Aaron Hunter <mailto:aamuhunt@ucsc.edu>

Projects for the OSAVC:


### Vehicle/Craft sensor driver development
 - **Topics**: Driver code to integrate sensor to a microcontroller
 - **Skills**: C, I2C, SPI, UART interfaces
 - **Difficulty** Easy
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Help develop a sensor library for use in autonomnous vehicles.  Possible sensors include range finders, ping sensors, IMUs, GPS receivers, RC receivers, barometers, air speed sensors, etc. Code will be written in C using state machine methodology and non-blocking algorithms. Test the drivers on a Microchip microncontroller. 

### IMU calibration algorithm development
 - **Topics**: Least Squares, DCM, 
 - **Skills**: C/Python, Matlab/Simulink, numerical optimzation algorithms
 - **Difficulty** Medium
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


The IMU is a sensor comprising nine separate sensors in a single package, including acceleromeeters, gyroscopes, and magnetometer. Using a model for sensor errors, develop calibration algorithms that characterize these errors and provide optimal estimates of the true sensor reading.  Provide an algorithm in C or Python to implement this efficiently on a microcontroller or single board computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

### Path finding algorithm using OpenCV
 - **Topics**: Computer vision, blob detection 
 - **Skills**: C/Python, OpenCV
 - **Difficulty** Medium
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Use OpenCV to identify a track for an autonomous vehicle to follow.  For example, a closed circuit course for an autonomous race car might be demarcated by different colored cones indicating the left and right boundaries of the track.  Use OpenCV to find and track the location of these cones as the car navigates the course. Implement initially on a laptop using video frames.  Ideally, transfer the algorithm to a Raspberry Pi and test on a real track.


### State estimation/sensor fusion algorithm development
 - **Topics**: Kalman filtering, Mahoney 
 - **Skills**: C/Python, Matlab/Simulink, numerical optimzation algorithms
 - **Difficulty** Challenging
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Implement an optimal state estimation algorithm from a model.  This model can be derived from a Kalman filter or some other state estimation filter (e.g., Mahoney filter).  THe model takes sensor readings as input and provides an estimate of the state of a vehicle. Finally, convert the model to standard C using the Simulink code generation or implement in Python (for use on a single board computer, e.g., Raspberry Pi)

### Vehicle dynamic model development
 - **Topics**: Dynamic modeling, control theory
 - **Skills**: C, Matlab/Simulink
 - **Difficulty** Challenging
 - **Mentor** Aaron Hunter


Help develop the library of models for autonomous vehicles. Develop a dynamic model of a vehicle based on standard vehicle types, e.g., differential-drive vehicle, surface vehicle (boat), quadcopter, etc.  Models to be developed in Matlab and ported to standard C.

## SkyhookDM

[SkyhookDM](http://www.skyhookdm.com)

The Skyhook Data Management project extends object storage with data 
management functionality for tabular data. SkyhookDM enables storing and query 
database tables in Ceph distributed object storage.  SkyhookDM is an 
[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) native 
storage system that utilizes the Arrow Dataset API to store and query data,
and our Ceph extensions support server-side data processing. For example, 
pushing down SELECT, PROJECT and other functionality into storage to reduce 
data returned to the client.

-------------------

### Add Ability to create and save views from Datasets

  - **Topics**: `Arrow`, `Database views`, `virtual datasets`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)

Problem - Workloads may repeat the same or similar queries over time. This causes repetition of IO and compute operations, wasting resources.  
Saving previous computation in the form of materialized views can provide benefit for future
workload processing. 
Solution - Add a method to the Dataset API to create views from queries and save the view as an object in a separate pool with some object key that can be generated from the query that created it. 

Reference:
https://docs.dremio.com/working-with-datasets/virtual-datasets.html

### Ability to Push back query execution to the Client in case of overloaded OSDs

  - **Topics**: `Arrow`, `query opererators`, `push down computation`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: High
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
   
Problem - Currently, SkyhookDM v0.1.0 just allows pushing down Compute operations such as selection and projection into the Storage layer (i.e the Ceph Object Storage Devices). With a large number of clients trying to push down computation into the OSDs at a time, the CPU and Memory pressure of the OSDs may quickly increase causing run-time side effects such as blocked and slow OSD operations.  
Solution - We can modify the Dataset API by adding a method to check the resource utilization on the Storage side periodically and if the CPU and Memory usage passes a user-defined threshold or some other metrice, the Datasets API silently shifts to client side query execution for a while and then tries to push down again.  This method could also be applied dynamically at the OSD, allowing the OSD to reject certain operations, returning metadata concerning which operations have not yet been applied.

### Port wiki to ReadTheDocs or other documentation platform

  - **Topics**: `Documentation`, `wiki`, `markdown`
  - **Skills**: Markdown, documentation, html
  - **Difficulty**: Easy
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)

SkyhookDM's documentation is [currently written](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-ceph/wiki)
as Github Wiki pages. We would like to move it to another platform such as 
[ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org), 
to reorganize it and rewrite some sections as part of this effort. 
[Github issue](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-ceph-cls/issues/42).

### Integrating Delta Lake on top of SkyhookDM

  - **Topics**: `data lakes`, `lake house`, `distributed query processing`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
  
[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is a new architecture for querying big data lakes through Spark, providing transactions.
An important benefit of this integration will be to provide an SQL interface for SkyhookDM functionality, through Spark SQL.
This project will further build upon our current work connecting Spark to SkyhookDM through the Arrow Dataset API.
This would allow us to run some of the TPC-DS queries (popular set of SQL queries for benchmarking databases) on SkyhookDM easily.

### Write Helm charts for easy deployment of the SkyhookDM, Dask , ServiceX stack on Kubernetes

  - **Topics**: `helm charts lakes`, `deployment`, `Dask`, `Kubernetes`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
  
Problem - In the IRIS-HEP DOMA project, SkyhookDM will be used to act as a lake house where data will be ingested from ServiceX. The Data stored in SkyhookDM will be processed by Coffea through several Dask workers. The deployment of this 3 layered end-to-end system is quite cumbersome and inefficient if done manually. Most importantly, it's a blockage to someone who would like to test out the entire system very quickly.

Solution - We can write Helm charts to easily deploy this end-to-end system on Kubernetes with just a few Helm commands. The goal is to deploy ServiceX, SkyhookDM, and Dask workers and ensure they can communicate with one another. We can expose the system to the end-users via a Jupyter notebook with some getting started code/guide.

### Facilitate continuous benchmarking/regression testing for the critical components of SkyhookDM

  - **Topics**: `helm charts lakes`, `deployment`, `Dask`, `Kubernetes`
  - **Skills**: C++
  - **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre) <mailto:jlefevre@ucsc.edu>, [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me/) [Jayjeet Chakraboorty](https://iris-hep.org/fellows/JayjeetChakraborty.html)
  
 
Problem - SkyhookDM,  which is a computational storage system built by embedding Apache Arrow is a performance critical distributed storage system. Often small changes in the performance critical parts of the source code can cause significant performance changes. It is very important to properly track these performance changes in order to allow the project to evolve more performant and prevent silent degradation in performance over time. 

Solution - We can use the Google benchmark framework to create benchmarks (very similar to unit tests) for all the performance critical parts of the source code. These benchmarks would be run on CI via Github workflows and would allow us to track the performance changes caused by every commit/pull request. We can also create a nice little web dashboard to visualize the performance results uploaded from the CI. But maybe this is another project on it’s own.

## SkyhookDM/HDF5

[HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/knowledge/What+is+HDF5) is a unique technology suite that makes possible the management of extremely large and complex data collections.
 
The HDF5 technology suite includes:
* A versatile data model that can represent very complex data objects and a wide variety of metadata.
* A completely portable file format with no limit on the number or size of data objects in the collection.
* A software library that runs on a range of computational platforms, from laptops to massively parallel systems, and implements a high-level API with C, C++, Fortran 90, and Java interfaces.
* A rich set of integrated performance features that allow for access time and storage space optimizations.
* Tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing the data in the collection.



-------------------

### HDF5 - Apache Arrow Integration

  * **Topics**: `VOL connector`, `streaming data`, `column store`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5, Apache Arrow
  * **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) creates in-memory column stores that can be used to manage streamed data.
Accessing this data through the HDF5 API would allow applications to take advantage of transient, column-oriented
data streams, such as realtime data from high-speed scientific instruments and cameras.  Bridging the gap between
science applications and analytics tools that use HDF5 and Apache Arrow data streams could bring new kinds of tools
and data together.  This project will create a standalone HDF5 [VOL connector](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Object+Layer)
that allows applications to make HDF5 calls to access Apache Arrow data.

-------

### HDF5 - Ceph RADOS Integration

  * **Topics**: `VOL connector`, `Ceph`, `object storage`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5, Ceph / RADOS
  * **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

The [Ceph](https://ceph.io) distributed storage system provides object, block, and file system layer interfaces.
A prototype HDF5 [VOL connector](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Virtual+Object+Layer) has been developed
to access the [RADOS](https://ceph.io/geen-categorie/the-rados-distributed-object-store/) object storage layer, enabling
HDF5 objects (datasets, groups, etc) to be directly stored as RADOS objects.  This project would expand the capabilities
of this VOL connector, enabling HDF5 applications to store data directly in RADOS pools.

-------

### Column-storage in HDF5

  * **Topics**: `HDF5`, `column-store`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5
  * **Difficulty**: High
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

[Column-oriented storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS) provides efficient access to fields within
records, across many rows.  Adding this storage method to HDF5 would dramatically improve performance for applications that
primarily access subsets of the fields in an HDF5 dataset.

-------

### Sparse data storage in HDF5

  * **Topics**: `HDF5`, `sparse data`
  * **Skills**: C, HDF5
  * **Difficulty**: High
  * **Mentor**: Quincey Koziol <mailto:koziol@lbl.gov>, Suren Byna <mailto:sbyna@lbl.gov>

[Sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) have applications in many fields within science and mathematics.
Storing and accesssing them in HDF5 is inefficient though, as HDF5 is currently optimized for storing dense arrays.
Adding efficient storage of sparse data in HDF5 would dramatically improve performance for applications that wish to store and
access sparse data.  This could extend beyond sparse matrices proper, and include any form of sparsely populated array or table.

-------

### Metadata search in HDF5 with Database Solutions

[Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) excel at many tasks, one of which is content queries.
HDF5 does not currently have good methods for indexing and searching available to user applications, although protoyping work
has been performed in a [git branch](https://bitbucket.hdfgroup.org/projects/HDFFV/repos/hdf5/branches?base=feature%2Findexing).
Instead of adding index and query operations directly to HDF5, this project would instead connect a database package, such as
[RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org) or [VoltDB](https://www.voltdb.com), with HDF5 and perform query and index operations in the
database and array-oriented I/O with HDF5.

## SkyhookDM/Proactive Data Containers (PDC)

[Proactive Data Containers](https://sdm.lbl.gov/pdc/about.html) (PDC) are containers within a locus of storage (memory, NVRAM, disk, etc.) that store science data in an object-oriented manner.  Managing data as objects enables powerful optimization opportunities for data movement and 
transformations, and storage mechanisms that take advantage of the deep storage hierarchy and enable automated performance tuning

[Proactive Data Containers (PDC)](https://sdm.lbl.gov/pdc/about.html) is an object-centric data management system for scientific data on high performance computing systems. It manages objects and their associated metadata within a locus of storage (memory, NVRAM, disk, etc.). Managing data as objects enables powerful optimization opportunities for data movement and transformations, and storage mechanisms that take advantage of the deep storage hierarchy and enable automated performance tuning. Currently PDC has a C interface. Providing a python interface would make it easier for more Python applications to utilize it. 


## CephFS
[CephFS](https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephfs/) is the distributed file system on top of [Ceph](https://ceph.io). It is implemented as a distributed metadata service (MDS) that uses dynamic subtree balancing to trade parallelism for locality during a continually changing workloads. Clients that mount a CephFS file system connect to the MDS and acquire capabilities as they traverse the file namespace. Capabilities not only convey metadata but can also implement strong consistency semantics by granting and revoking the ability of clients to cache data locally.

### CephFS namespace traversal offloading

  * **Topics**: `Ceph`, `filesystems`, `metadata`, `programmable storage`
  * **Skills**: C++, Ceph / MDS
  * **Difficulty**: Medium
  * **Mentor**: Farid Zakaria, [Carlos Maltzahn](https://people.ucsc.edu/carlosm)

The frequency of metadata service (MDS) requests relative to the amount of data accessed can severely affect the performance of distributed file systems like CephFS, especially for workloads that randomly access a large number of small files as is commonly the case for machine learning workloads: they purposefully randomize access for training and evaluation to prevent overfitting. The datasets of these workloads are read-only and therefore do not require strong coherence mechanisms that metadata services provide by default.

The key idea of this project is to reduce the frequency of MDS requests by offloading namespace traversal, i.e. the need to open a directory, list its entries, open each subdirectory, etc. Each of these operations usually require a separate MDS request. Offloading namespace traversal refers to a client’s ability to request the metadata (and associated read-only capabilities) of an entire subtree with one request, thereby offloading the traversal work for tree discovery to the MDS. 

Once the basic functionality is implemented, this project can be expanded to address optimization opportunities, e.g. describing regular tree structures as a closed form expression in the tree’s root, shortcutting tree discovery.

## Popper

[Popper](https://getpopper.io) is a container-native task automation engine that runs on distinct container engines, orchestration frameworks and CI services. Write simple YAML files, run everywhere.

### Popper / Drone workflow translation

  * **Topics**: `Popper`, `drone.io`, `workflow`, `reproducibility`, `containers`, `cloud native`
  * **Skills**: YAML, Python, Docker
  * **Difficulty**: Easy
  * **Mentor**: [Carlos Maltzahn](https://people.ucsc.edu/carlosm)

[Drone](https://github.com/drone) is a Container-Native, Continuous Delivery Platform with a similar functionality as Popper. In some areas Drone is more mature than Popper, but Popper is easier to debug. Both specify workflows in easy-to-read YAML files. The goal of this project is to be able to easily switch between Popper and Drone, e.g. to debug Drone workflows with Popper. This can be accomplished by implementing a translator that converts a Popper workflow into a Drone workflow and vice versa.

### Event Based Job Scheduler

  * **Topics**: `workflow`, `data processing`, `machine learning`
  * **Skills**: YAML, Python, Docker, Kubernetes

  * **Mentor**: [Carlos Maltzahn](https://people.ucsc.edu/carlosm), James Norman

The defacto industry standard for scheduling and reacting to updates in Data Processing is [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org). However there are many use cases that can be solved with much simpler tools. The goal of the project is to build a prototype for this. This could be a component of a larger toolset for Data Processing in the enterprise.

### Simple Write-Once-Read-Many Feature Store

  * **Topics**: `data processing`, `key/value store`, `machine learning`, `data serving`

A very common problem in ML (or generic data) Serving is exporting companion :KeyValue" data from the lake and consuming this data at serving/inference/request time. Often this pattern is called a "Feature Store" but in has many other use cases. In general this data goes to Dynamo or some other full fledged database, which is overkill for the use case, as the data always follows a Write Once Read Many (WORM) pattern. This project attempts to solve the problem by, at training/processing time, taking the dataset or Spark Dataframe and mapping it into shards of embeddable databases (ie Sqlite or RocksDB) then just load the database files into a service when they're needed.

### In-store processing on Computational Storage Devices using DASK(A distributed python library)
  * **Topics**: `data processing`, `distributed computing`, `Computational storage devices`

Barbalace and Do outline various computational models in their paper “Computational Storage: Where are we today”. One of such models is the use of the client-server paradigm as a programming model. Using a client-server model, a network channel between the host and the CSD CPUs is what is required. The proposed solution is the use of DASK, a python library for writing distributed programs, for communication between hosts and several CSDs. The project will build APIs that runs on DASK which will involve opening files across multiple CSDs, carrying parallelized  data-processing like filtering on individual CSDs.
